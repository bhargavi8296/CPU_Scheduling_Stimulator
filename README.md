# CPU Scheduling Simulator 🎮💻

## Overview 🌟
The *CPU Scheduling Simulator* is an interactive web-based tool designed to visualize the workings of various CPU scheduling algorithms. This project provides a clear, real-time demonstration of how processes are managed by the CPU, making it a valuable resource for students and professionals learning about operating systems.

## Features ⚡
- *Interactive Visualization*: Real-time charts and animations show the execution of different CPU scheduling algorithms. 📊
- *Customizable Input*: Users can input process arrival times and burst times to see how different algorithms handle task scheduling. ⏲️
- *Real-Time Updates*: Watch CPU scheduling progress dynamically, enhancing understanding of algorithm behavior. 🔄

## Supported Algorithms 🧠
The simulator covers the following common CPU scheduling algorithms:
1. *First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)* 🚶‍♂️  
   Simple, non-preemptive algorithm that executes processes in the order they arrive.
2. *Shortest Job First (SJF)* ⏳  
   Non-preemptive algorithm that prioritizes the shortest burst time for optimal turnaround time.
3. *Round Robin (RR)* 🔄  
   Preemptive scheduling algorithm that assigns a fixed time slice to each process in a circular order.
4. *Priority Scheduling* ⭐  
   Executes processes based on assigned priorities, which may result in starvation for lower-priority tasks.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- *HTML* 🌐
- *CSS* 🎨
- *JavaScript* ⚙️

## How to Use 🚀
1. *Clone the Repository*  
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone (https://github.com/bhargavi8296/CPU_Scheduling_Stimulator.git)
